# Fraud Detection with Decision Tree

This project aims to build a fraud detection model using decision trees. 

The goal is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions in order to protect consumers and businesses from financial loss.

The model is implemented from scratch using the Python programming language.

## File Structure

The project directory contains the following files and folders:

- `mini_dataset.csv`: the minimized version of our dataset for training and testing the model

- `fraud_detection.ipynb`: implementation of the decision tree algorithm
